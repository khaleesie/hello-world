# hello-world
My idea repository.

Hi, I'm Sierrah and I like to learning new languages (including Italian and JavaScript). I also like my dogs, coffee, and pho. You can find me in my free time watching Seinfeld on Hulu, learning how code with App Academy, or napping. I'm 23 and live in downtown Kansas City, MO (for now) with my boyfriend Logan.
